Puppet module: openssh

# Based on Example42 modules
# http://www.Example42.com

Licence: Apache2

DESCRIPTION:
------------

This module installs and manages openssh.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the openssh::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/openssh/manifests/params.pp).
Here you can:
    - Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
    - Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
    - Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
      Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.

USAGE:

# Standard Classes
include openssh              # Install and run openssh

include openssh::absent      # Remove openssh package.
include openssh::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                         # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                         # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes

                         # Automatically included if $backup=yes
                         # Requires Example42's backup module

                         # Automatically included if $firewall=yes
                         # Requires Example42's firewall module

include openssh::puppi       # Puppi extensions for the openssh module
                         # Requires Example42's puppi module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. (EXPERIMENTAL)
openssh::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic

# Module specific classes

Module GENERAL VARIABLES:
-------------------------

Modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting
them, but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.

$my_project
    If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour and
    files's deploy logic in custom project classes The custom class
    openssh::$my_module autoloads from MODULEPATH/openssh/manifests/$my_project.pp but
    you can place it in a separated module by explicitely importing it:
    "import $my_project" to have something like
    MODULEPATH/$my_project/manifests/openssh.pp

$base_source
    Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
    - not set: Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
    - set    : Files are in $base_source ( Ex: $base_source = "puppet://myfileserver" )

    Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25

$debug
    If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
-------------------------------

$puppi
    Set to "yes" to enable openssh plugins for puppi
    Check openssh/manifests/puppi.pp for more info.

$monitor
    Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes

$monitor_tool
    Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
    Check openssh/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on openssh monitoring related variables.

$backup
    Set to "yes" to enable auto backuping classes

$backup_tool
    Defines the backup tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
    Check openssh/manifests/backup.pp for more info on openssh backuping related variables.

$firewall
    Set to "yes" to enable auto firewalling classes

$firewall_tool
    Defines the firewall tools to activate.
    Check openssh/manifests/firewall.pp for more info on openssh firewalling related
    variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

Usage of Example 42 "common" module may be required in these cases:

    - $common:: variables are used in this module
    - You use the experminetal (and not much tested) openssh::conf define for infile lines configuration
